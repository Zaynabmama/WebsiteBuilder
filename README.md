<img src="./readme/title2.svg"/>

> A web-based platform that allows users to create, customize, and deploy websites effortlessly by selecting pre-designed components and deploying the site with a single click on netlify. The goal is to simplify website creation and make it accessible for everyone, regardless of technical expertise.


### User Stories
- As a user, I want to choose from various website components, so I can build a site that meets my needs.
- As a user, I want to preview my website before deploying it, so I can ensure it looks as expected.
- As a user, I want to deploy my website with a single click, so I can publish it quickly and easily.

###  Website Builder is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the Next.js and NestJS frameworks. Next.js is a powerful React-based framework that enables optimized web application development with server-side rendering and static site generation. NestJS is used for building scalable server-side applications with a structured architecture using Node.js.

- The project utilizes MongoDB as the database management system, which provides flexible schema design and high scalability for data storage and retrieval.

- To provide real-time customization, the app features a Customization Panel, allowing users to modify component properties with instant visual feedbackâ€”no manual saving required.

- For deployment, the project can be integrated with the Netlify API using an API key, enabling automated deployments and continuous integration directly from the repository.
